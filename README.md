BestPracticeSlides
==================

Repo for the code used in the MolMed TechTalk about best practices in scientific computing.

Try this code by checking out the repository with `git clone https://github.com/johandahlberg/BestPracticeSlides.git`

The project is build using sbt. To build, run, etc. go into the BestPracticeSlides folder and type `sbt`. This will open the sbt console. To compile, simply type: `compile`. To run the tests `test`, and finally to run type `run` and then choose the main class that you want to run. (You should get exactly the same results as the ugly verison is just a tricker-to-read version of the better version).
